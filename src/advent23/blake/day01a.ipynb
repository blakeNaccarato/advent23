    "> <p>Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.</p>\n",
    "> <p>You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all <em class=\"star\">fifty stars</em> by December 25th.</p>\n",
    "> <p>Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <em class=\"star\">one star</em>. Good luck!</p>\n",
    "> <p>You try to ask why they can't just use a <a href=\"/2015/day/1\">weather machine</a> (\"not powerful enough\") and where they're even sending you (\"the sky\") and why your map looks mostly blank (\"you sure ask a lot of questions\") <span title=\"My hope is that this abomination of a run-on sentence somehow conveys the chaos of being hastily loaded into a trebuchet.\">and</span> hang on did you just say the sky (\"of course, where do you think snow comes from\") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet\" target=\"_blank\">trebuchet</a> (\"please hold still, we need to strap you in\").</p>\n",
    "> <p>As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been <em>amended</em> by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document.</p>\n",
    "> <p>The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific <em>calibration value</em> that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the <em>first digit</em> and the <em>last digit</em> (in that order) to form a single <em>two-digit number</em>.</p>\n",
    "> <p>For example:</p>\n",
    "> <pre><code>1abc2\n",
    "> pqr3stu8vwx\n",
    "> a1b2c3d4e5f\n",
    "> treb7uchet\n",
    "> </code></pre>\n",

    "Let's use regular expressions to solve it. Note that the first cell here contains our imports, and the cell is marked as \"parameters\" (that's a cell tag). This will allow us to inject different `INPUT` values in to test our notebook against different conditions. Your `OUTPUT` (your solution to the puzzle) should appear in a different cell than the `parameters`-tagged cell, in order for the parameter injection to work."
