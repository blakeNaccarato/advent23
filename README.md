# advent23

Collaboration on Advent of Code 2023.

Each day, a new challenge is released over at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). If a template doesn't exist for a particular question, create one in `src/advent23` and update `ANSWERS` in `tests/advent23_tests/__init__.py`. One of us must solve the full problem and update `ANSWERS` in order for tests to activate for everyone.
